## Prerequisite for Local Development

1. Spin up Mongo
```bash
# spin up the mongo db
docker-compose up -d 
```

2. load your s3 bucket instance by setting this env 
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

3. set up the testing STMP provider
    options: ethereal[https://ethereal.email/]
```bash
    SMTP_HOST: "",
    SMTP_PORT: "",
    SMTP_USER: "",
    SMTP_PASSWORD: "",
    SMTP_FROM_EMAIL: "",
    SMTP_FROM_NAME: "",
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
